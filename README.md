Early release supporting sorting .properties files with the syntaxe:

`## Group Title` (everything below this title will be sorted and titles will be sorted as a group)
`# comment` (comments stay above the lines that they were originally a comment for)
`prop=Me` (normal property line)

Properties not under a group will be added to the `## Misc` group.


Use the prebuilt JAR to install this.
